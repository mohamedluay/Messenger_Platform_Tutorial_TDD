# Messenger Platform Tutorial (TDD Approach)

Welcome to this tutorial made for the [Developer Circle Community Challenge 2020](https://developercircles2020.devpost.com). This tutorial was built using the concepts of TDD ([Test Driven Development](https://www.infoq.com/articles/test-driven-design-java/)), where I have prepared all the tests for you so that you can have each lesson in the **Red State**üî¥. In each lesson, you are job will be turning these red states one by one into green ones, hence, complete the tutorial.

Hence you can consider this tutorial is **2 in 1** tutorial, from one side it is a tutorial designed to cover the [Messenger Platform](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform) and how to build a chatbot using the platform, and from the other side (As a By-product) you will get more familiar with TDD and how to use it in real life applications.

before going into the tutorial itself, make sure to follow read the following in order to proceed with setup and preparations.

_p.s after being qualified to the final round for the Developer Circle Community Challenge, I have added few lessons on the native support of Wit.ai within the messenger platform, hence we can say that this tutorial is now a **3 in 1** tutorial üòÅüòé_

### Installation Guide

In order to use this tutorial, all you need to have is a [docker desktop app](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-app) so that you can build the image and start the container. Steps:

1.  Clone this repo.
2.  Go to the root folder in the master branch in the terminal, and run the following command:

```
./scripts/start_docker.sh test
```

**start_docker.sh** is a shell script I wrote to run this container main commands & services. If you want to force building this image, you can append **--build** to the same command

```
./scripts/start_docker.sh test --build
```

This test container is configured as a test environment that you can use to follow up with the lessons. For the TDD part and each lesson preparation, I have wrote another script that you will use to get the tests of each lesson, e.g:

```
./scripts/start_tutorial.sh lesson_5
```

In a green state, it will look something like this üì∏ üëá
